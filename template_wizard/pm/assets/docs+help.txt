Launch page text

Welcome to the much anticipated Header & Footer wizard.  A few notes before launching:

* We <strong>strongly recommend</strong> that you log in with a departmental net id account or something that your web team shares.  This will ensure that your header/footer preferences, which the wizard can save, are not tied to your personal net id account.
* There are three code output options: Copy & Paste, Include or Both.  Each option has detailed documentation to help you install the HTML into your sites.
* The header/footer code has been stress tested on the following browsers:

* As far as we can tell, the code passes XHTML transitional and CSS 2.0.
* Remember, the wizard and the resulting code it produces are in beta.  Should you stumble across any defects or strange behavior, please <a href="mailto:uweb@uw.edu">notify us</a> immediately and we'll update do our best to fix the wizard and/or code its producing.

Got those down?  Good!  Now, get clicking...
