Issue: IE doctype bug
Date reported: 2009.11.09
Date fixed: 2009.11.09 - IE doctype consideration added to our FAQ and Install docs:
Reported by: Scott Bush
Severity: medium
Status: fixed, closed

Problem: IE7 and IE8 both truncate the patch and wordmark if the doctype is not at least xhtml1 transitional.  The report received was from a user who was using HTML4 transitional as their DTD.

Solution: The following text was added to our documentation (FAQ + Help)

"Thus far (cross your fingers), the only known issue with IE is a DTD problem.  The header and footer code, both the include and copy/paste, work best with the XHTML1 transitional DTD: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">"

Issue: Javascript search box text
Date reported: 2009.11.01
Date fixed: 2009.11.05
Reported by: Michael Dunlap
Severity: low
Status: fixed, closed

Problem: "The javascript for clearing the search box will clear the search text even if the user has entered in their own text. I would recommend checking the value of the input for being “Search the UW” before blanking it." -Michael D.

Was: function make_blank() {document.uwglobalsearch.q.value = "";}

Is: function make_blank() {if(document.uwglobalsearch.q.value == "Search the UW") {document.uwglobalsearch.q.value = "";}}
